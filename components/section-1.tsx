            Infinite in mystery is the gift of the Goddess

            We seek it thus, and take to the sky

            To become the dew that quenches the land

            To spare the sands, the seas, the skies
            <br />I offer thee this silent sacrifice

            Her Providence sought nothing. Her Providence made nothing. She but
            looked on, silent in Her sorrow. The Goddess pitied mortals,
            destined as they were to die, and so She deigned to intervene in the
            hour of their greatest peril. She averted cataclysm that was to be,
            and put to rest the ones who would have robbed so many of what time
            fate had ordained. Her compassion did not end at this. The Goddess
            pitied also those subjected to that fate of Focus, crueler still
            than death. To them She sent Her messengers, to deliver hope when
            all was lost.
